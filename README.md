# RegexToDFA-CFG-TOAProject
A Flask web application that converts regular expressions to Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA), generates equivalent Context-Free Grammars (CFG), and Pushdown Automata (PDA) representations with visualization capabilities.

It supports: 

Converting Regular Expressions to Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA).

Translating Regex to Context-Free Grammar (CFG).

Visualizing the structure of finite automata.

Demonstrating key concepts in Theory of Automata and Formal Languages.

Designed for educational use and exploration of computational theory concepts.
